				Hi there, 
			</p>
			<p>
				I’m Aymeric Bourguilleau, freelance content creator & community manager originally from France and now based in Phnom Penh, Cambodia.	
			</p>
			<p>		
				I’ve spent the last +5 years working in the digital communication, making viral content on social media for brands, TV channels or lifestyle company.
			</p>
			<p>
				In a world where digital communication has become the norm. We need something more to stand out crowd. Viral, trendy and quality content is now a must have if you want to share your vision worldwide without forgetting the most important: the emotion and the vision behind the idea / the project or the association 
			</p>
			<p>
				That's why I choose to help other to have the visibility they deserve ! Inspiring people, products, association or location through my films, photography, and content.
